SELECT * FROM `YOUR_PROJECT.news_classification_dataset.article_data`


2. First, see which categories were most common in the dataset.

SELECT category, COUNT(*) c FROM
  `YOUR_PROJECT.news_classification_dataset.article_data`
GROUP BY category ORDER BY c DESC



3. If you wanted to find the article returned for a more obscure category like 
/Arts & Entertainment/Music & Audio/Classical Music, you could run the following query:

SELECT * FROM `YOUR_PROJECT.news_classification_dataset.article_data`
WHERE category = "/Arts & Entertainment/Music & Audio/Classical Music"

4. To get only the articles where the Natural language API returned a confidence score greater than 90%, run the following query:

SELECT article_text, category
FROM `YOUR_PROJECT.news_classification_dataset.article_data`
WHERE cast(confidence as float64) > 0.9
